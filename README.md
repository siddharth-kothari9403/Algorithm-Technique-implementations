# Algorithm-Technique-implementations
Implementations of algorithms learnt as a part of Design and Analysis of Algorithms course

The repository contains the following codes:

# Divide and Conquer
1. Program to count inversion pairs in an array using merge sort
2. Program to find the peak of a unimodal array
3. Program to find the majority element of an array
4. Program to merge k sorted arrays
5. Program to find the median of 2 sorted arrays

# Greedy
1. Program to group people into groups such that the age difference is atmost 2, and minimum groups are formed.
2. Interval covering algorithm
3. Interval partitioning
4. Interval Scheduling problem

# Dynamic Programming
1. Program to find the longest palindromic subsequence within a string
2. Program to find a knapsack such that weight is maximised and weight <= W
3. Program to find the longest increasing subsequence of an array.
4. Weighted Interval Scheduling
5. Word break- finding if it is possible, finding the min no of words it breaks into, and printing all possible words
6. Program to print all palindromic partitionings of a string
7. Program to find partition of an array into 2 sets such that their difference is minimised
8. Coin Change problem
9. Program to find the longest substring which is present in the array, and the reverse of it is also present, and they don't overlap.
